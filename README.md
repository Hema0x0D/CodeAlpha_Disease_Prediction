# Disease Prediction from Medical Data 🩺

This repository contains my implementation of a **Disease Prediction Model** as part of my internship with **CodeAlpha**. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical data.

## 📁 Project Overview

Heart disease is a major global health concern, and early prediction is crucial for preventive healthcare. In this project, I built a robust classification model using the **Heart Disease dataset** to predict disease presence.

## 🛠️ Pipeline

✅ **Data Loading & Exploration**  
- Loaded the heart disease dataset (Cleveland dataset).  
- Explored dataset structure and checked for missing values.  

✅ **Preprocessing**  
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  
- Split data into **training** and **testing** sets (80/20 split).  

✅ **Model Building**  
- Used **XGBoost Classifier** for its strong performance in tabular data.  
- Tuned hyperparameters for best results.  

✅ **Model Evaluation**  
- Evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.  
- Plotted the **ROC curve** with AUC score to visualize model performance.

## 📊 Results

- Final model **accuracy**: **85%**  
- **Confusion Matrix**:
